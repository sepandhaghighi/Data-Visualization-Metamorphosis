## Data Visualization Idea

Fraud detection is a process that detects and prevents fraudsters from obtaining money or property through false means. It is a set of activities undertaken to detect and block the attempt of fraudsters from obtaining money or property fraudulently. Fraud detection is prevalent across banking, insurance, medical, government, and public sectors, as well as in law enforcement agencies. 

Our main idea in this hackathon is to comprehensively examine and visualize the available data related to fraud detection in the Ethereum network.

Our suggested steps to visualize data:

1. Downloading and collecting data
2. Data cleaning
3. Data statistics and distribution
4. Comparing different features of data between fraud and non-fraud classes

## Datasets

We will use two data set in this report.

1. [Ethereum Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset)
2. [Ethereum Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gescobero/ethereum-fraud-dataset)

We will analyze these two datasets both individually and in combination.
